# Parneet-Brar--Coding-Competition
This code displays a hello world pattern using strings in java. 
The story behind the program is I wanted to use multidementional arrays to display a hello world pattern however, I run out of time and decided to use srtings instead.
The program is simple to run as you would run and other java program. 
In blue J you can right click on the helloworld class and select voidmain(String args[])to run the program.
